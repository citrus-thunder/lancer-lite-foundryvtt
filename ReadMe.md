# Lancer Lite for Foundry Virtual Tabletop

A minimalistic [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer) system for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

This system is only intended to provide the absolute bare-minimum functionality required to play Lancer in Foundry. For a more fully-featured Lancer/Foundry system, check out [foundryvtt-lancer by Eranziel](https://github.com/Eranziel/foundryvtt-lancer).

    "description": "<p><em>Pilots are creative and driven people, but Mesa Rownett is an exceptional case -- excessively so, some would say. In his spare time, he's managed to scrape together just enough scrap, requisitioned materials, and workshop space to apply a little oldfashioned ingenuity to his mech, fashioning it to a formidable machine not betrayed by its outward appearance.</em></p>\n<h2>Rank I: Prototype</h2>\n<p>When you perform a <strong>FULL REPAIR</strong>, you can, with some trial and error, install a prototype weapon system on your mech. You may choose characteristics for your prototype weapon based on the following profile each time you perform a FULL REPAIR, rerolling 1d6+2 to determine <strong>LIMITED </strong>each time:</p>\n<h3>Prototype Weapon</h3>\n<p><em>Main [Melee, CQB, Rifle, Cannon, Launcher, Nexus], Limited [1d6+2], Overkill</em></p>\n<p>This weapon is an experimental prototype, customized according to your specific requirements. When you install it, or during a <strong>FULL REPAIR</strong>, you may choose a new weapon type, damage type, and either <strong>THREAT </strong>1 (melee) or <strong>RANGE 10</strong> (all other types). Additionally, each time you perform a <strong>FULL REPAIR</strong>, reroll 1d6+2 to determine this weapon's <strong>LIMITED</strong> uses. Damage: 1d6+2 Kinetic, Explosive, or Energy .</p>\n<p>This weapon counts as an integrated mount and does not require a mount</p>\n<h2>Rank II: Revision</h2>\n<p>You can tweak the essential components of your prototype weapon in order to increase its effectiveness. When you perform a <strong>FULL REPAIR</strong>, choose two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TWEAKED OPTICS:</strong> Your prototype weapon always gains +1 <strong>ACCURACY</strong> on attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>TWEAKED COMPUTER</strong>: Your prototype weapon is <strong>SMART</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>STRIPPED REACTOR SHIELDING:</strong> Each time you attack<br>with your prototype weapon, you may choose -- at the cost of 2 <strong>HEAT</strong> -- to attack with one of the following options, depending on its weapon type: <br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RANGED WEAPON: </strong><strong>CONE 3, LINE 5,</strong> or [<strong>BLAST 1, RANGE 10]</strong></li>\n<li><strong>MELEE WEAPON:</strong> <strong>BURST 1</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rank III: Final Draft</h2>\n<p>Your prototype weapon is now <strong>LIMITED [2d6]</strong> and deals <strong>1d6+4</strong> damage.</p>",
